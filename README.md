# Personal-Journal-App
A very simple note taking app for jotting down something quick,
without the distraction of too many bells and whistles.
Everything is saved to and queried from a SQLite database.

It has four functions:
1. Creating notes
2. Viewing notes
3. Editing notes
4. Deleting notes

Update!
A light / dark theme has been added, as well as updated the UX!
